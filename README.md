# SodaMachineDebugging_Lab

Notes
Modern IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio Code contain many helpful tools, primary among them is the debugger. Trying to code without using the debugger is like working in the dark. A developer in modern work needs to be as comfortable using the IDE tools to debug their code as they are writing the code itself!
The starter code for this project contains many bugs and errors! You are expected to place breakpoints throughout the code and identify what the bugs/errors are, brainstorm how you might fix them, and then attempt to fix them by writing new code or adjusting the code that’s already there.

Tasks
Task 1: Attempt to run the application
You will quickly notice that there are many errors & exceptions that will make themselves known in the stack trace when you try to run the program! Resolve these one at a time.
Task 2: Fix the bugs 
Bugs are different from errors. Bugs will not prevent the program from running, they simply cause the program to behave incorrectly. You’ll know you have moved on to the bug fix step when you are able to start the program and nothing seems to happen!
Task 3: Place breakpoints
Now you will want to place breakpoints and follow along with the code as it executes to try to discover where things are going wrong. 

💡 Remember you can set up multiple breakpoints and skip over cumbersome methods by using the Continue button!

End Result
See Project Walkthrough video for how the fully working application should function.
When properly debugged, the application will allow a user to:
buy a soda with exact change and have the soda show up in their backpack
buy a soda by overpaying and get correct change
not buy a soda if insufficient payment is entered
Additionally, all messages must make sense and display correct information reflecting the state of the objects in the application.
